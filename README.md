# RecipePicker_CSharp
Recipe Picker is an application with recipes. An user can search,view and add an recipe.
I will implement two roles for my application:
#### I. User role
When a user is using my application, there are several things he
can do:
 1. Register/Login;
 2. See recipes by category;
 3. See a recipe detalis;
 4. Add a recipe to favorite recipes;
 5. Add a recipe to cooked recipes;
 6. Search a recipe by name and category;
 7. Update his profile by adding a profile photo and adding own recipes;
 8. See his profile including: his own recipes, the recipes added to cooked recipes and the recipes added to favorite recipes;

#### II. Admin role
As an admin, the application provides him a different interface ,where he can do the following :
1. Register/Login;
2. See all users;
3. See all recipes;
4. Add/Edit/Delete a recipe;
